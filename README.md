# linear-regression-model
implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
Steps:
Import Libraries: First, import the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
Load Dataset: Use a dataset containing house prices, square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
Preprocess Data: Prepare the data by separating the features (square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms) and target variable (house prices).
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Fit Linear Regression Model: Use scikit-learn to fit a linear regression model to the training data.
Evaluate Model: Use metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
Prediction: Predict house prices based on new data.
